## 📌 Featured Projects

### 🔹 [Custom Deep Learning Framework](#): 
Implemented Forward, Backward pass with backprop, & optimization for MLP, CNN, and RNN mimicking PyTorch libraries. 

### 🔹 [LLM Powered Clinical Summarization](#): 
Developed a large language model (LLM) pipeline using AWS Bedrock, HuggingFace, LangChain, and Cohere to automate prior-authorization document summarization for healthcare payers.

### 🔹 [Streaming Twitter Spam Classifier](#): 
Developed an online spam classifier using Naive Bayes and MOA Hoefding adaptive tree learners; tested with imbalanced data and cross-validation for robustness.

### 🔹 [CNN for MNIST](#): 
Trained a CNN with 99.2% accuracy on the MNIST dataset using deep convolutional layers and hyperparameter tuning.

### 🔹 [Vehicle Detection and Motion Tracking](https://github.com/ry639a/Vehicle-detection-and-Motion-tracking)
Implemented motion detection using Background Subtraction (MOG) in C++. This project focuses on detecting and tracking moving vehicles in video sequences, leveraging OpenCV for real-time processing.

### 🔹 [Panoramic Image Stitching](https://github.com/ry639a/Panoramic-Stiching)
Developed an image stitching application using SURF feature detection and FLANN-based matching in C++. It seamlessly combines multiple images into a single panoramic view.

### 🔹 [LRU and VMS Implementation](https://github.com/ry639a/LRU-and-VMS-Implementation)
Simulated memory management techniques by implementing Least Recently Used (LRU) and Variable Memory Size (VMS) algorithms in C. This project aids in understanding paging and caching mechanisms.

### 🔹 [Peer-to-Peer Secure Messaging App](https://github.com/ry639a/Peer-to-Peer-Secure-Messaging-App)
Built a Java-based peer-to-peer messaging application emphasizing secure communication protocols. It ensures encrypted message exchange without relying on centralized servers.

### 🔹 [Data Visualization](https://github.com/ry639a/DataVisualization)
Created dynamic visualizations using Processing to represent complex datasets interactively. This project showcases the power of visual storytelling in data analysis.

### 🔹 [Automatic Zigsaw Solver](https://github.com/ry639a/Automatic-Zigsaw-Solver)
Engineered a C++ solution to automatically solve jigsaw puzzles by analyzing piece shapes and patterns, demonstrating algorithmic problem-solving skills.
